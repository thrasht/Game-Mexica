# Game-Mexica
I made this game for my Algorithm class at school.

Is developed in pure C and the structure is based on Lists.

# Source code
The source code is in C칩digo/C칩digo del Programa/MEXICA.cpp file.

#Image Editor
This game contains an image editor to build your own images to the project. You can compile or just execute from the C칩digo/Editor de Im치genes folder.
